# The Future of Web Development

Web development is constantly evolving, with new technologies and frameworks emerging regularly.
The rise of AI-powered development tools, WebAssembly, and edge computing are revolutionizing how we build
web applications.

## Key Trends

### 1. AI-Powered Development

AI is transforming how we write code. Here's a simple example of AI-assisted code generation:

```javascript
// AI-powered code completion
function calculateOptimalRoute(points) {
  return points.reduce((optimal, point) => {
    // AI suggests the most efficient path
    return [...optimal, point].sort((a, b) =>
      calculateDistance(a, b));
  }, []);
}
```

### 2. WebAssembly

WebAssembly is enabling high-performance web applications that were previously only possible in native code.

### 3. Edge Computing

Edge computing is bringing computation closer to the data source:

```typescript
// Edge function example
export default async function handler(request: Request) {
  const userLocation = request.headers.get('cf-ipcountry');

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    nearest: findNearestEdgeNode(userLocation)
  }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
}
```

As we move forward, we're seeing a greater emphasis on:
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility standards
- Enhanced user experiences
